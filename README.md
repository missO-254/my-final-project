Project Overview: Sanctuary AI - Proactive Relationship Health
Lumina AI is an AI-powered public health tool designed to shift the narrative from crisis intervention to proactive self-awareness and boundary setting in relationships. Rooted in the principle, "#Before you chase love, find yourself first," the system empowers individuals to build a strong sense of self-worth to proactively identify and resist manipulation and toxic patterns.
