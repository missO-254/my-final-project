**Lumina - Clarity Over Crisis**

AI-Powered Awareness Platform for Preventative Emotional Wellness (SDG 3)

Lumina is an AI-powered platform designed to reduce emotional, mental, and relational crises by empowering people with radical clarity, self-awareness, and early detection of harmful patterns.

Every year, millions silently suffer emotional manipulation, psychological abuse, and identity erosion—often without realizing it until the damage is overwhelming. Lumina exists to bridge that gap by transforming confusion into clarity.

**Mission**

To cultivate deep self-awareness, emotional grounding, and proactive clarity in every individual — ensuring that fewer people fall into harmful relationships, identity crises, or preventable mental breakdowns.

**🧠 What Lumina Solves**

Most people walk through life disconnected from:

Who they truly are

Their core values

What healthy relationships look like

What patterns signal danger

The difference between love and manipulation

This lack of awareness leads to:

✔ emotional burnout

✔ financial depletion

✔ distorted self-worth

✔ cycles of trauma

✔ unsafe relationships (IPV is a leading cause of femicide worldwide)

Lumina’s goal is simple:
Give people clarity before crisis.
