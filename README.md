Project Overview: Lumina AI - Proactive Relationship Health

Lumina is an AI-powered public health tool designed to shift the narrative from crisis intervention to proactive self-awareness and boundary setting in relationships. Rooted in the principle, "#Before you chase love, find yourself first," the system empowers individuals to build a strong sense of self-worth in order to live fulfilling lives, identify and resist manipulation and toxic patterns.

SDG Alignment
Primary: SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) — Addressing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as a critical public health crisis.

Secondary: SDG 5 (Gender Equality) — Targeting the systemic roots of female vulnerability to abuse and manipulation.

The Problem: The Hidden Global Crisis
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is not merely a relationship issue; it is a leading cause of severe harm, resulting in femicide, chronic health issues, and socioeconomic instability for women globally. Lack of early self awareness regarding subtle emotional manipulation is a primary enabler of this tragedy.

Key Data Validation Points
60% of all female homicides worldwide are committed by an intimate partner or family member. (source-UN Women / UNODC (2023)
Women experiencing IPV are twice as likely to experience depression and PTSD, and have higher rates of chronic conditions.(Source -WHO / APA)
Socioeconomic Domestic violence is a leading cause of homelessness for women and children in many regions. (source - National Coalitions)

The Solution: Three Pillars of Empowerment
Lumina AI operates across three interconnected, AI-powered modules to instill self-grounding before an individual finds themselves high-risk situations:

Self-Discovery Quiz: A personalized tool that guides the user to define their core values, personal goals, and non-negotiable boundaries, establishing their unique Grounding Baseline.

Red Flag Tracker: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze structured check-ins, identifying the frequency of behaviors like gaslighting, isolation, and control against the user's Grounding Baseline.

Boundary Setting Coach: Provides active, conversational practice (via a simulator) to help users recognize manipulation and removing themselves, directly challenging the learned narrative of prioritizing pleasing others.

MVP Showcase: The Unapologetic 'No' Simulator
The initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) demonstrates the core skill-building functionality of the Boundary Setting Coach.

File Location: src/boundary_coach.py

Function: A text-based conversational simulator that role-plays a typical manipulative scenario. The AI analyzes the user's response for keywords that indicate weakness or apology, providing immediate, non-judgmental feedback to strengthen their resolve.
